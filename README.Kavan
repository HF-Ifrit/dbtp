Week 8: 11/16

Week 7: 11/9
  Work Done:
	* Deployed nginx production server to display our website
	* ec2-34-203-191-246.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	* caught up to last week's feature of guest account cookies
	* Note: revision 549b00f4, 1f3bcedf, c714616c, e5eb7b84, and f4d8f193 are my commits, I committed on the aws server while Kaius was working on the project in aws. Since I only created one account on the server that meant changing git name would apply to both users. I wasn't able to fix author name mistake but those commits are mine. We have changed work flow to only develop locally and treat aws as production server only.
